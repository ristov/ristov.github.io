<h2>LogCluster</h2>

LogCluster is an experimental Perl-based tool for log file clustering and
mining line patterns from log files. The development of LogCluster was
inspired by <a href="https://ristov.github.io/slct/">SLCT</a>, but LogCluster 
includes a number of novel features and data processing options.
<p>
LogCluster is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL, with the latest version
being <a href="logcluster-0.09.tar.gz">0.09</a> (released in June 29, 2017).
<p>
In order to install LogCluster, copy the 'logcluster.pl' file from the 
distribution to the appropriate directory.
Execute <a href="logcluster.txt">logcluster.pl --help</a> for getting detailed 
help on usage and command line options.
<p>
A detailed discussion of the LogCluster algorithm and its application for security 
log analysis can be found in papers published at
<a href=/publications/cnsm15-logcluster-web.pdf>CNSM 2015</a>
and
<a href=/publications/milcom16-logcluster-web.pdf>MILCOM 2016</a>.
Also, experiments with C-based LogCluster prototype are outlined
<a href=/publications/ids17-logclusterc-web.pdf>here</a>.
<p>
Finally, a paper published at 
<a href=/publications/noms18-log-anomaly-web.pdf>NOMS 2018</a>
describes an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for syslog messages which 
is powered by LogCluster.
