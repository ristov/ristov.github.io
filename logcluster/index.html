<h2>LogCluster</h2>

LogCluster is an experimental Perl-based tool for log file clustering and
mining line patterns from log files. The development of LogCluster was
inspired by <a href="http://ristov.github.io/slct/">SLCT</a>, but LogCluster 
includes a number of novel features and data processing options.
<p>
LogCluster is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL, with the latest version
being <a href="logcluster-0.07.tar.gz">0.07</a> (released in March 14, 2016).
<p>
In order to install LogCluster, copy the 'logcluster.pl' file from the 
distribution to the appropriate directory.
Execute <a href="logcluster.txt">logcluster.pl --help</a> for getting detailed 
help on usage and command line options.
<p>
A detailed discussion of the LogCluster algorithm can be found in a
<a href=/publications/cnsm15-logcluster-web.pdf>paper</a>
published at CNSM 2015.
