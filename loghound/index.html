<h2>LogHound - a tool for mining frequent patterns from event logs</h2>

LogHound is a tool that was designed for finding frequent patterns from
event log data sets with the help of a breadth-first frequent itemset mining
algorithm. LogHound can be employed for mining frequent line patterns from 
raw event logs, e.g.,
<p>
Dec 18 * myhost.mydomain * log: Connection from * port
<br>
Dec 18 * myhost.mydomain * log: Password authentication for * accepted.
<p>
but also for mining frequent event type patterns from preprocessed event logs.

LogHound has been tested on Redhat Linux and Solaris (compiled with gcc), 
but is likely to compile and work on other platforms as well.
