<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

LogHound is a tool that was designed for finding frequent patterns from
event log data sets with the help of a breadth-first frequent itemset mining 
algorithm. LogHound views each line from input file(s) as a 
<I>transaction</I>

that consists of
<I>items</I>

(each item is unique in a transaction). A set of items (or
<I>itemset</I>)

is said to be 
<I>frequent</I>

if at least N transactions contain all items from this set, where the value
of N (or the
<I>support threshold</I>)

is given by the user with the
<B>-s </B>

option. 
The
<I>support</I>

of an itemset is the number of transactions that contain all items from this 
itemset.
<P>

If LogHound is started without the
<B>-g</B>

option, it assumes that input file(s) are raw event logs, and it mines 
frequent line patterns from the file(s).
In that case each line from input file(s) is considered a transaction with 
word-position pairs as items. E.g., LogHound views the line
<P>

Password authentication for john accepted
<P>

as a transaction {(Password, 1), (authentication, 2), (for, 3), (john, 4),
(accepted, 5)}. Note that each frequent itemset corresponds to a certain
line pattern, e.g., the itemset {(Password, 1), (authentication, 2), 
(for, 3), (accepted, 5)} represents the line pattern
<P>

Password authentication for * accepted
<P>

If LogHound is started with the
<B>-g</B>

option, it assumes that each line from input file(s) represents a set of
events (e.g., events from a user ftp session), and it mines frequent event
type patterns from the file(s).
In that case each line from input file(s) is considered a transaction with 
events as items (the order of events is not important). 
E.g., LogHound views the line
<P>

FanFailure LinkDown LinkUp
<P>

as a transaction {FanFailure, LinkDown, LinkUp}.
<P>

In order to mine frequent itemsets (patterns), LogHound uses a breadth-first
search strategy and keeps detected frequent itemsets in a trie data
structure. Although the popular Apriori algorithm also works in a
breadth-first manner and its implementations often employ the itemset trie,
the algorithm that is built into LogHound is in several respects different
from Apriori. The differences will be described below.
<P>

As its first step, LogHound will detect frequent items. In order to do that, 
it makes a pass over the input data set and counts how many times each 
item occurs. The item occurrence counters are kept in a move-to-front hash 
table data structure (the number of slots in the table can be specified 
with the 
<B>-w</B>

option). Unfortunately, since the number of items can be very large in
event log data sets, this step could consume a lot of memory. If many items
are infrequent, storing counters for them in memory is a waste of space;
however, before the data set has been completely processed, it is impossible 
to tell which items will finally be infrequent.
<P>

To cope with this problem, LogHound can be instructed to make an extra pass 
over the input data set as its very first step, and build an 
<I>item summary vector </I>

of size M before the item counting (the value of M is given with the
<B>-v</B>

option). The item summary vector is made up of M counters that are 
initialized to zero. During the pass over the data set, every item is 
hashed to an integer value from 0 to M-1. Each time the hash value I is
calculated for an item, the Ith counter in the vector will be incremented. 
Since efficient hashing functions are known to distribute their input 
values uniformly across the output range, each counter in the vector will
correspond roughly to N / M items (where N is the total number of items). 
The value of the Ith counter equals to the sum of occurrence times of all 
items which hash to the value I.
After LogHound has constructed the item summary vector, it will find the
occurrence times of only those items for which the counter values in 
the summary vector are equal or greater than the support threshold. 
If many of the items in the data set are infrequent, many of the counter
values will not exceed the support threshold, and a significant amount of
memory will be saved during the item counting. 
<P>

After frequent items have been detected, LogHound will ignore infrequent
items in transactions during further mining (since if an item is
infrequent, it can't be a part of any frequent itemset).
In order to speed up the mining process, LogHound will load a part of the
data set into memory and store it in the cache trie. For each transaction,
LogHound considers the set of all frequent items from that transaction. 
Cache trie is guaranteed to contain every such set which occurs at least for 
N transactions in the data set (the value of N is given with the
<B>-n</B>

option). Sets which are not stored to the cache trie are written to the 
out-of-cache file (the location of this file is given with the
<B>-o</B>

option). To detect, which sets should be loaded into memory, LogHound
uses the summary vector technique described above, and loads the set into
memory only if corresponding counter in the 
<I>transaction summary vector </I>

is not below N (note that if we simply count the occurrence times of sets, 
all sets would end up being in memory together with their occurrence counters).
In that way, more frequently used transaction data are guaranteed to be in 
main memory, while less frequently used data remain on disk.
<P>

During the mining process, LogHound detects frequent itemsets in a
level-wise manner, building the itemset trie layer by layer. If the
<B>-l</B>

option is given, LogHound does not look for frequent itemsets that contain
more items than specified by the option. Unlike Apriori,
LogHound uses a heuristic for reducing the number of nodes in the trie,
in order to reduce its memory consumption and runtime. When the mining is
complete, LogHound derives all frequent itemsets from the nodes 
of the itemset trie and outputs them. Since a node in the trie can represent
several itemsets that all have the same support, LogHound outputs a concise 
description for these itemsets, with variable items in parentheses.
E.g., the description
<P>

(Nov) * * (myserver) * log:
<BR>

Support: 1249
<P>

represents four frequent itemsets with the support 1249:
<P>

Nov * * myserver * log:
<BR>

Nov * * * * log:
<BR>

* * * myserver * log:
<BR>

* * * * * log:
<P>

If the 
<B>-c</B>

option is given, LogHound will output closed frequent itemsets only (closed 
itemset is an itemset that has no superset with the same support).
<P>

LogHound writes its output to standard output, and logs its messages to 
standard error.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b &lt;byte offset&gt;</B>

<DD>
when processing the input file(s), ignore the first &lt;byte offset&gt; bytes of
every line. This option can be used to filter out the possibly irrelevant 
information in the beginning of every line (e.g., timestamp and hostname).
The default value for the option is zero, i.e., no bytes are ignored.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
output closed frequent itemsets only.
<DT><B>-d &lt;regexp&gt;</B>

<DD>
the regular expression describing the item delimiter in input file(s). 
The default value for the option is '[ \t]+', i.e., items are separated 
from each other by one or more space or tabulation characters.
<DT><B>-f &lt;regexp&gt;</B>

<DD>
when processing the input file(s), ignore all lines that do not match the
regular expression. The regular expression can contain ()-subexpressions, 
and when
<B>-t</B>

&lt;template&gt; option has also been given, the values of those subexpressions 
can be retrieved in &lt;template&gt; through $-variables. When
<B>-f</B>

and
<B>-b</B>

options are used together, the
<B>-b</B>

option is applied first.
<DT><B>-g</B>

<DD>
assume that each line in input file(s) represents a set of events, and mine
frequent event type patterns from the file(s). 
If this option is omitted, it is assumed that input file(s) are raw event 
log(s), and frequent line patterns will be mined from the file(s).
<DT><B>-i &lt;seed&gt;</B>

<DD>
the value that is used to initialize the 
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+rand">rand</A></B>(3)

based random number generator which is used to generate seed values for
hashing functions inside LogHound. The default value for the option is 1.
<DT><B>-l &lt;max itemset size&gt;</B>

<DD>
don't mine itemsets containing more than &lt;max itemset size&gt; items.
<DT><B>-n &lt;cache trie support&gt;</B>

<DD>
create a cache trie that is guaranteed to contain transaction itemsets
present at least &lt;cache trie support&gt; times in the data set. The default
value for the option is zero, i.e., load the entire input data set into main
memory.
<DT><B>-o &lt;out-of-cache file&gt;</B>

<DD>
The location of the out-of-cache file. When this option is omitted, the
entire input data set is loaded into main memory.
<DT><B>-t &lt;template&gt;</B>

<DD>
template that is used to convert input lines, after they have matched the
regular expression given with the
<B>-f</B>

option. Template is the string that will replace the original input line, 
after the $-variables in the template have been replaced with the values
of ()-subexpressions from the regular expression. For example, if the regular 
expression given with the
<B>-f</B>

option is 'sshd\[[0-9]+\]: (.+)', and the template is &quot;$1&quot;, then the line
<BR>

<I>sshd[1344]: connect from 192.168.1.1 </I>

<BR>

will be converted to 
<BR>

<I>connect from 192.168.1.1 </I>

<BR>

before the line will be processed by the mining algorithm that is built 
into LogHound. This option is meaningless without the
<B>-f</B>

option.
<DT><B>-v &lt;item vector size&gt;</B>

<DD>
the size of the item summary vector. The default value for the option is
zero, i.e., no summary vector will be generated.
<DT><B>-w &lt;item table size&gt;</B>

<DD>
the number of slots in the item hash table. The default value for the
option is 100,000.
<DT><B>-z &lt;transaction vector size&gt;</B>

<DD>
the size of the transaction summary vector. If this option is omitted
or zero is specified for its value, the summary vector of size
(the number of frequent items * 100) is used. This option is meaningless
without the
<B>-n</B>

or the
<B>-o</B>

option, or when zero is specified for the value of the
<B>-n </B>

option.
<DT><B>-s &lt;support&gt;</B>

<DD>
the support threshold value. The value can be either an integer, or a real 
number with a trailing %-sign.
