<h2>Monitord - system monitoring daemon</h2>

Monitord is a compact Perl-based tool for watching the health of UNIX systems.
Monitord monitors the local system by watching the process table, load 
average figures, the amount of free space in file systems, and the output of
custom monitoring scripts.
<p>
Monitord is not tied to any system management framework (e.g., HP OpenView),
and executes custom commands for producing its output. Therefore, monitord
can be plugged in to any existing monitoring framework - provided 
the framework has a reasonable API -, or used as a standalone tool.
<p>
Monitord's configuration file resembles the configuration file of the Net-SNMP
agent, except a number of additional parameters. However, unlike any SNMP
agent, monitord does not have to be polled for getting results, but it rather
produces asynchronous output events which is a more scalable approach. Monitord
is also able to generate periodic keepalive events, so its own health can
be monitored by another applicaton.

Monitord is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL, with the latest version
being <a href="monitord-1.95.tar.gz">1.95</a>.

In order to install monitord, copy the 'monitord' file from the distribution
to the appropriate directory.
