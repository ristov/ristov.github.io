<h2>SCAS - Stream Clustering Algorithm for Suricata</h2>

SCAS (Stream Clustering Algorithm for Suricata) is a stream clustering 
algorithm designed for classifying Suricata IDS alerts in EVE format 
in real time, and mining frequent alert patterns that represent commmon 
attack scenarios of low importance.
<p>
