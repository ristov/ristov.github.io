<h2>SLCT - simple logfile clustering tool</h2>

SLCT is a tool that was designed to find clusters in logfile(s), so that each 
cluster corresponds to a certain line pattern that occurs frequently enough. 
Here are some examples of the clusters that SLCT is able to detect:
<p>
Dec 18 * myhost.mydomain sshd[*]: log: Connection from * port *
<br>
Dec 18 * myhost.mydomain sshd[*]: log: Password authentication for * accepted.
<p>
With the help of SLCT, one can quickly build a model of logfile(s), and also 
identify rare lines that do not fit the model (and are possibly anomalous).
<p>
SLCT has been tested on Linux and Solaris (compiled with gcc), 
but is likely to compile and work on other platforms as well.

There is also a 
<a href=/publications/slct-ipom03-web.pdf>paper</a>
about SLCT (published at IPOM 2003). 
<p>
Papers about the application of SLCT for log mining and IDS alert
classification have been published at
<a href=/publications/slct-loghound-noms08-web.pdf>NOMS 2008</a> and
<a href=/publications/cnsm10-ids-web.pdf>CNSM 2010</a>.

algorithm that is designed as an improvement over SLCT.
